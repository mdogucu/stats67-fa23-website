They are also a great time to just chat with us if it is not too crowded :)\nWe want to be mindful of you who commute to campus so if you’d choose to attend office hours virtually, we will also be available online via zoom. The hours and locations can be checked under People. UCI zoom account to attend the zoom meeting.\n\n\nOnline Discussion\nWe will have an online forum. While communicating online, please note the following:\n\nBefore posting a question, please make sure that the same question has not been posted before.\nRespect opinions of others.\nIf you choose to post memes or any jokes, be mindful. Any joke about a person, or a group of people, or cultures is not funny. However, statistics and data science jokes are always welcome.\nThere are absolutely no stupid questions. Do not feel shy about asking questions. Do not judge anyone about any question that they ask. You can post anonymously. Others would not know who you are but I would know who you are.\nIf somebody asks a question about homework etc. do not reveal answers for them. Instead, help them learn and show them in which lecture we have covered the topic.\nBe generous with likes. That means when you read something useful like the post, so that we all know that we are not talking to ourselves but to each other.\nAnswer each other’s questions.\n\n\n\nE-Mail\nPlease do not email me about course content unless it is private to you. If you are running into an issue, it is very likely that someone else is also having the same issue. Please post on the discussion forum so that we can all learn together. This way I would only answer the question once and everyone can benefit. In fact, your TA or one of your peers may even answer it before I do. You can get a much quicker response.\nWhile communicating over email, please make sure the email - has an informative subject line including the course code. - articulates your question or problem well. - has a closing statement such as Sincerely, Kind Regards* etc. - has your name at the end.\nHere is a sample email:\n\nSubject: STATS 67 - Your Subject\n\n\nDear Dr. Dogucu,\nI hope you are doing well (or some other humane sentence). I am writing to you regarding ______________ (Your concern or problem). (Any explanations, requests or suggestions for solutions to your problem)\nSincerely/Kind regards,\nYour name"

This syllabus (i.e., course website) clearly labels instructions on when and how you can work with others, tools you can use, and under what conditions. If there are no instructions for any assignments, you should assume that the work should be completed by you only from start to finish without help of others and AI tools like ChatGPT. Academic dishonesty includes, for example, cheating on examinations or any assignment, plagiarism of any kind (including improper citation of sources), having someone else take an examination or complete an assignment for you (or doing it for someone else), or any activity in which you represent someone else’s work as your own. Violations of academic integrity will be referred to the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct. You cannot share or distribute solutions online or offline or in any media now or in the future. You cannot obtain solutions from others. If there is evidence of academic misconduct , intentionally or unintentionally, YOU WILL FAIL THE CLASS. This rule applies even if you violate the policies of this course on a single problem, on an assignment, the whole assignment or multiple assignments. No matter what the degree of academic dishonesty is, you will fail the class. It is your responsibility to protect your answers being copied. Make sure not to save work on shared folders. It may be difficult to distinguish helping each other learn and cheating together. If you are unsure of the distinction check with me before hand."

    "text": "It is my intent to design assessments that are a source of intellectual curiosity, joy, and learning rather than a source of stress. Assessments serve the purpose of measuring how much you have learned (i.e. how much you have achieved of the course goals). I would recommend you to first focus on your learning, then grades will follow.\n\nIn-Class Quizzes\nIn-Class quizzes are opportunity to practice as you are learning during the lectures. The questions will be asked sporadically throughout the lectures. You can discuss quiz questions with your neighbors in class, check notes, use internet etc. You will be graded for participation, not for correctness. You need to be attending the lecture in order to receive the participation point. If you are not in participating in lecture or have someone else participate for quizzes on your behalf, this will be considered academic misconduct.\n\n\nHomework Assignments\nAt the end of Wednesday after weekly topics are completed you will be assigned a homework on these topics. You will have until Sunday 11:59 pm to finish the homework assignments. For homework assignments, you can use books and notes, talk to other people in your class, use online resources including ChatGPT however there are some limitations.\n\nUse tools and discuss with people to LEARN. Do not use tools or discuss with people to simply copy and submit the homework.\nDo not copy as is from the internet or your peers or any other person.\nDo not pay someone or a website to do the work for you.\nThe work you submit should be reflective of your understanding. In other words, the teaching assistants and I hold the right to question you anytime about your submission. If you cannot answer about, discuss, articulate what you have submitted then we might look further into if the work submitted is not yours or copied and take appropriate action.\nAt the end of each homework, you will be asked whether you have done the homework by yourself, with a peer(s), or used tools like ChatGPT. If using ChatGPT, then you will be asked to submit your prompts and how it supported your learning. If you do not acknowledge any help from a person or ChatGPT, we will consider this cheating.\n\nTLDR; Use tools or people to help you learn BUT acknowledge in detail how this helped your learning.\n\n\nMidterm Exam\nMidterm exam will be held in-person, in-class on Nov 1st. You will work individually on the exam. It will be a closed-book exam but you will be given equations. You will not need a calculator and thus you will not be allowed to use one.\n\n\nFinal Exam\nFinal exam will be held in-person, for Lecture A group on Mon, Dec 11 at 8:00-10:00am and for Lecture B group on Wed, Dec 13 at 8:00-10:00am. You will work individually on the exam. It will be a closed-book exam but you will be given equations. You will not need a calculator and thus you will not be allowed to use one."
