Thus, we strongly encourage you to go over your assignments to check for the correctness of your grade. You should immediately notify us if there are any errors. For all assignments other than the final, you have one-week after receiving feedback and grade from us to ask for regrading to correct any errors. For the final exam, you will have 24 hours to request regrading. For assignments on Gradescope you can send regrade requests directly within Gradescope. For others, you can email Christian and add me to CC field of the email. Note that the grade on Canvas Gradebook will be the official grade and you should check for its correctness."

Thus, we strongly encourage you to go over your assignments to check for the correctness of your grade. You should immediately notify us if there are any errors. For all assignments other than the final, you have one-week after receiving feedback and grade from us to ask for regrading to correct any errors. For the final exam, you will have 24 hours to request regrading. For assignments on Gradescope you can send regrade requests directly within Gradescope. For others, you can email Christian and add me to CC field of the email. Note that the grade on Canvas Gradebook will be the official grade and you should check for its correctness."

Attending office hours is an effective way to ask me or your TA questions you may have. They are also a great time to just chat with us if it is not too crowded :)\nWe want to be mindful of you who commute to campus so if you’d choose to attend office hours virtually, we will also be available online via zoom. The hours and locations can be checked under People. UCI zoom account to attend the zoom meeting.\n\n\nOnline Discussion\nWe will have an online forum. While communicating online, please note the following:\n\nBefore posting a question, please make sure that the same question has not been posted before.\nRespect opinions of others.\nIf you choose to post memes or any jokes, be mindful. Any joke about a person, or a group of people, or cultures is not funny. However, statistics and data science jokes are always welcome.\nThere are absolutely no stupid questions. Do not feel shy about asking questions. Do not judge anyone about any question that they ask. You can post anonymously. Others would not know who you are but I would know who you are.\nIf somebody asks a question about homework etc. do not reveal answers for them. Instead, help them learn and show them in which lecture we have covered the topic.\nBe generous with likes. That means when you read something useful like the post, so that we all know that we are not talking to ourselves but to each other.\nAnswer each other’s questions.\n\n\n\nE-Mail\nPlease do not email me about course content unless it is private to you. If you are running into an issue, it is very likely that someone else is also having the same issue. Please post on the discussion forum so that we can all learn together. This way I would only answer the question once and everyone can benefit. In fact, your TA or one of your peers may even answer it before I do. You can get a much quicker response.\nWhile communicating over email, please make sure the email - has an informative subject line including the course code. - articulates your question or problem well. - has a closing statement such as Sincerely, Kind Regards* etc. - has your name at the end.\nHere is a sample email:\n\nSubject: STATS 67 - Your Subject\n\n\nDear Dr. Dogucu,\nI hope you are doing well (or some other humane sentence). I am writing to you regarding ______________ (Your concern or problem). (Any explanations, requests or suggestions for solutions to your problem)\nSincerely/Kind regards,\nYour name"

This syllabus (i.e., course website) clearly labels instructions on when and how you can work with others, tools you can use, and under what conditions. If there are no instructions for any assignments, you should assume that the work should be completed by you only from start to finish without help of others and AI tools like ChatGPT. Academic dishonesty includes, for example, cheating on examinations or any assignment, plagiarism of any kind (including improper citation of sources), having someone else take an examination or complete an assignment for you (or doing it for someone else), or any activity in which you represent someone else’s work as your own. Violations of academic integrity will be referred to the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct. You cannot share or distribute solutions online or offline or in any media now or in the future. You cannot obtain solutions from others. If there is evidence of academic misconduct , intentionally or unintentionally, YOU WILL FAIL THE CLASS. This rule applies even if you violate the policies of this course on a single problem, on an assignment, the whole assignment or multiple assignments. No matter what the degree of academic dishonesty is, you will fail the class. It is your responsibility to protect your answers being copied. Make sure not to save work on shared folders. It may be difficult to distinguish helping each other learn and cheating together. If you are unsure of the distinction check with me before hand."
