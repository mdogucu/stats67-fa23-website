While we will try our best to make sure that your grade is correct, it is possible for us to make minor mistakes in grading unfortunately. 
Thus, we strongly encourage you to go over your assignments to check for the correctness of your grade. 
You should immediately notify us if there are any errors. 
For all assignments other than the final, you have one-week after receiving feedback and grade from us to ask for regrading to correct any errors. 
For the final exam, you will have 24 hours to request regrading.
For assignments on Gradescope you can send regrade requests directly within Gradescope. 
For others, you can email your TA and add me to CC field of the email. 
Note that the grade on Canvas Gradebook will be the official grade and you should check for its correctness.
