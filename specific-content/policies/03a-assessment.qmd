It is my intent to design assessments that are a source of intellectual curiosity, joy, and learning rather than a source of stress. Assessments serve the purpose of measuring how much you have learned (i.e. how much you have achieved of the course goals). I would recommend you to first focus on your learning, then grades will follow. 

### In-Class Quizzes

In-Class quizzes are opportunity to practice as you are learning during the lectures. 
The questions will be asked sporadically throughout the lectures. You can discuss quiz questions with your neighbors in class, check notes, use internet etc. 
You will be graded for participation, not for correctness.
You need to be attending the lecture in order to receive the participation point. 
If you are not in participating in lecture or have someone else participate for quizzes on your behalf, this will be considered academic misconduct.


### Homework Assignments

At the end of Wednesday after weekly topics are completed you will be assigned a homework on these topics. You will have until Sunday 11:59 pm to finish the homework assignments. 
For homework assignments, you can use books and notes, talk to other people in your class, use online resources including ChatGPT however there are some limitations.

- Use tools and discuss with people to LEARN. Do not use tools or discuss with people to simply copy and submit the homework.
- Do not copy as is from the internet or your peers or any other person.
- Do not pay someone or a website to do the work for you.
- The work you submit should be reflective of **your** understanding. In other words, the teaching assistants and I hold the right to question you anytime about your submission. If you cannot answer about, discuss, articulate what you have submitted then we might look further into if the work submitted is not yours or copied and take appropriate action.
- At the end of each homework, you will be asked whether you have done the homework by yourself, with a peer(s), or used tools like ChatGPT. If using ChatGPT, then you will be asked to submit your prompts and how it supported your learning. If you do not acknowledge any help from a person or ChatGPT, we will consider this cheating.

TLDR; Use tools or people to help you learn BUT acknowledge in detail how this helped your learning.
