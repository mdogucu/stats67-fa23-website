Late work is not accepted except for homework assignments. 
On homework assignments if the submission is later than the due date and time, then 25% of the achieved total grade will be deducted for every 12 hours that the submission is late. 
For example, if you were to get 12 points out of 15 on a homework assignment and you submitted 15 hours late then your score would be 6 points.
